# HackPrinceton2

## Inspiration
The idea sparked during our brainstorming session in the convocation room- a spacious room filled with large portraits of notable figures and professors from Princeton University. We were looking to execute a project related to augmented reality and thought how awesome it would be to have the paintings come to life and explain the narrative of the art piece (i.e. in a way much like the fat lady guarding Gryffindor's homeroom in Harry Potter). But unfortunately, magic isn't real and we had to take a step back to think about practical ways in which we could make understanding art engaging, enriching and comprehensible. 

## What it does
DocentAR is a mobile app that is designed for museum-goers to _better understand art_. Alright we will admit, that previous sentence sounds vague and abstract, but it is exactly how appreciating art is like to the masses. Museum-goers may lack sufficient knowledge to fully appreciate the work and let's not forget how artwork labels are often written in convoluted styles. 

In this version of the product, we brought Vincent Van Gogh to life, for him to explain "The Starry Night" (1989) to the audiences. With an AR enable device, museum-goers would be able to see and hear an avatar of Van Gogh sharing about the painting from both his perspective as well as that of art critics. With DocentAR, we make it easier for the layperson and even young children to understand art, cultivating a world that appreciates creativity, beauty, and freedom of expression. 

To increase the functionality of the product, we also designed an AR map that enables museum-goers to easily navigate around the building. 

## How we built it
We first tested the viability of the technology with a metro card and a 3D model of a table- all within Unity 3D and Vuforia API. After witnessing success, we went into Blender 3D to design the 3D models and recorded the voiceovers for the product. (_p.s. Van Gogh was voiced over by a girl_) We then animated and combined the voiceovers in Unity3D. 

## What's next for DocentAR
DocentAR presents only one of many possibilities of what we could do with such a product. In the short run, we could further refine the AR processing capabilities alongside its navigation feature and user interface, to develop a full-fledged app for museum-goers. In the long run, we foresee developing technology that could easily allow anyone and everyone to create their own avatar and share their story with the world.
